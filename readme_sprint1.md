## Overview

**Project Title**: Cloud Databases

**Project Description**: Course manager in the cloud

**Project Goals**: Get an understanding of Cloud databases and build an interface to interact with the cloud

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install python
2. Install firebase, pyrebase, and CustomTKinter
3. Open a cmd shell and run the app.py file to create an account through firebase
4. Run the database.py file to run different queries or add/update/delete data from the firestore database

Instructions for using the software:

1. Change the commented out lines within the database.py file to choose how you want to interact with the database
2. Can un-comment and run the ctkinter or demo files to see examples of GUIs that were being prototyped

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.12
* From the command line install: pyrebase4, firebase, CustomTKinter

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
* [Get Started with Firebase Authentication on Websites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start)
* [YouTube: Python Firebase Email Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_3YFEEovCc&t=732s)

* [YouTube: An introduction to customtkinter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvzK9Oguxcg&t=868s)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Get the CustomTKinter GUI working properly
* [ ] Fully integrate the authentication
* [ ] Be able to preform database functions like query, add, update, and delete all from the terminal/GUI
